# When Chromatography Meets Chemometrics: A Journey Through Multivariate Analysis

This project demonstrates the application of multivariate analysis techniques—specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA)—to chromatographic (HPLC) data for quality monitoring and batch comparison in chemical products. The workflow includes essential chemometric preprocessing steps such as **baseline correction**, **peak alignment**, and the application of **ANOVA** to detect statistically significant differences between production groups.

## What's inside

- R Markdown report: `ACP_HPLC.rmd`, detailing the entire chemometric pipeline
- High-quality visualizations located in `graphs/`
- Optional GitHub Pages publication to showcase the project as a personal portfolio

This repository is part of my chemometrics portfolio focused on the integration of analytical chemistry and data science.
